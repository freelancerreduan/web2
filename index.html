  <br>
  <h2>How long does it take to learn to touch type?</h2>
  <p>You can choose how many lessons, exercises, and writing tests you will do. It takes between 6 to 10 hours to complete the entire basics course. If you prefer a shorter course, complete only the first two units of Lessons 1 – 10. The first two units of Lessons 1 – 10 will teach you the location of the alphabet keys on the keyboard. You can choose to complete each lesson unit or you can complete just a portion of any lesson unit and move on to another lesson.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>How long should I practice daily?</h2>
  <p>As touch-typing is a cumulative motor skill, it would be ideal to practice daily or at least every second day. Developing good keyboarding skills throughout the course is also essential. Therefore, proper touch-typing should be reinforced whenever possible, preferably for at least 15 minutes every day. Of course, this is not always possible.
    <br><br>
    Variation in motor skill acquisition is great between individuals so it is difficult to set a definite minimum or maximum limits to a keyboarding session, but, in general, short periods of practice will yield better results than very long sessions. For best results, daily practicing periods should vary from 15 minutes to about one hour in length.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h2>How do you have good ergonomics?</h2>
  <p>To reduce stress in shoulder area, keyboard and mouse should be placed next to one another so that reaching is not necessary. Chair height and/or work surfaces must be adjusted so that the wrists and forearms remain in a straight line. Usually the best working posture for your arms is achieved when the input devices are at about elbow height.
    When working for long periods of time staring at a computer display it is important that the neck constantly remains in a relaxed position. Therefore the monitor must be placed and tilted so that it is directly in front of the user at or below eye level. This ensures that the head is not turned to left or right or awkwardly tilted upwards, which causes a lot of strain to neck and shoulder area. Placing the documents adjacent to the monitor or directly below it also helps to avoid neck pain when the students do not have to constantly twist and turn their necks. The monitor must be kept clean.</p>
    <br><br>
    <h2>How to have a good body posture?</h2>
    <p>There are a few useful guidelines that should always be kept in mind when working on a computer. It may be a good idea to print out these guidelines and keep them near workstation so that they can be easily referred to whenever necessary. <br>
      - Do not lift your shoulders, this causes tension. <br>
      - Rest your elbows close to your body. Use armrests whenever possible. <br>
      - Do not bend or twist your neck. <br>
      - Keep your forearms and wrists in a straight line. <br>
      - Keep your fingers slightly curved. <br>
      - Keep your feet flat on the floor or on a footstool.      <br>
      - Use a light touch when typing. <br>
      Remember that no position or posture is correct for long periods of time. Remember to change positions frequently, take small breaks and stretch or even walk around a bit. Regular movement will prevent discomfort and fatigue effectively.</p>
      <br><br>
